# octo.erl [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sdepold/octo.erl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sdepold/octo.erl) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/sdepold/octo.erl/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/sdepold/octo.erl?branch=master)

The library `octo.erl` is a wrapper for the Github API written in Erlang.
It focuses on reading data. Write ability might be added later.

## Installation

You can install `octo.erl` via rebar. Just add it as dependency to your `rebar.config`:

```erlang
{deps, [
  {octo, ".*", {git, "git://github.com/sdepold/octo.erl.git", {branch, "master"}}}
]}.
```

Afterwards you can download and compile it:

```
rebar get-deps compile
```

## Usage

### Application

Even though it's a library, it has a state to keep. Thus, you must start its
application before calling any of the library's functions:

```erlang
application:start(octo).
```

### Records

This lib ships a couple of record definitions which can be loaded via the `include_lib` directive:

```erlang
-include_lib("octo/include/octo.hrl").
```

Or in the Erlang shell:

```erlang
rr("deps/octo/include/octo.hrl").
```

### Authentication

At te moment, octo.erl only supports authentication using OAuth2 Token (sent in
a header). To set it, run `octo:set_credentials(pat, "d34dbeef")`.

### API

All the following commands return tuples Ã  la:

```erlang
{ok, Result}
```

### Pagination

GitHub API [paginates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination) its responses
wherever possible. octo.erl can either fetch all the pages for you in one call
(effectively hiding pagination from you), or it can let you handle it yourself.

To make octo.erl fetch all the pages, read about `all_pages` option below.

If you decided to consume pages one by one, here's how you do it:

1. make an ordinary request:

   ```erlang
   {ok, Page1} = octo:list_whatever(you, want).
   ```

2. ask octo.erl to fetch the next page of results:

   ```erlang
   {ok, Page2} = octo:list_whatever({next, Page1}).
   ```

You can request `prev`, `next`, `first` and `last` pages.

Pagination is supported by all of the "list" functions.

There's a caveat, though. The following code will result in a cache miss,
costing you a tiny bit of memory for an unused cache entry and also making
a call to API that would otherwise be avoided.

```erlang
{ok, Page1} = octo:list_whatever("user", "repo"),
{ok, Page2} = octo:list_whatever({next, Page2}),
{ok, Page1Again} = octo:list_whatever({prev, Page2}).
```

This only affects the first page of the results. For details, see [this
comment](https://github.com/sdepold/octo.erl/issues/25#issuecomment-198951078)
in our issue tracker.

### Options

All of the aforementioned functions can be called with an additional options
parameter. It has to be a proplist (a list containing `{key, value}` pairs;
`{key, true}` is equivalent to `key`). The following options are supported:

#### Number of results per page

By default, GitHub returns 30 results per page. To change that to, say, 100
results per page, do the following:

```erlang
Options            = [{per_page, 100}],
{ok, PullRequests} = octo:read_pull_request(Owner, Repo, Number, Options).
```

#### Reading all entries

If you don't want to do the pagination manually, you can provide an option that
resolves all pages automatically:

```erlang
Options            = [all_pages],
{ok, PullRequests} = octo:read_pull_request(Owner, Repo, Number, Options).
```

## Development notes

`octo.erl` uses rebar as build tool. You can install it on OS X like this:

```
brew install rebar
```

You can compile the code like this:

```
git clone git@github.com:sdepold/octo.erl.git
cd octo.erl
make
```

### Running the tests

Unit tests can be run at any time with the following command:

```
make tests
```

You'll see a lot of info reports from SASL about `octo` application being
stoppedâdon't panic, this is an expected behaviour. Look for a line saying "All
N tests passed" or check the exit code (should be zero).

Integration tests are a bit more involved:

1. (Optionally) Create a dedicated login for testing.

   While it's not strictly necessary, separate login minimises the chances of
   breaking anything important.

2. Clone `sdepold/octo.erl-test` repo (under the testing login).

3. Set `TESTING_LOGIN` environment variable.

4. Generate an authentication token (for the testing account) and set
   `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. It's sufficient to give it access to your
   repos, as we don't support anything else at the moment anyway.

5. Now, you can run tests with:
   ```
   make integration-tests
   ```
